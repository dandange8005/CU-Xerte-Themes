## Open-props

I integrated [open-props](https://open-props.style/) into my project. 

Open-props is a collection of CSS custom properties (variables) that can help me to create consistent designs. It has a collection of tokens:

1. Colors
    Base colors (various hues)
    Gray scales
    Surface colors
    Brand colors
    Gradient colors

2. Typography
    Font families
    Font sizes
    Font weights
    Line heights
    Letter spacing

3. Sizes
    Size scales
    Fluid sizes


4. Spacing
    Fixed spacing values
    Fluid spacing values


5. Borders
    Border widths
    Border styles
    Border radii


6. Animations
    Easing functions
    Animation speeds/durations


7. Shadows
    Box shadows
    Text shadows

8. Aspects (aspect ratios)
9. Media Queries
    Breakpoints
    Container queries
10. Z-index scales
11. Gradients
12. Miscellaneous

    Focus rings
    Masks
    Blend modes


However, I don't use all the tokens. 

## Questions

- How to use only the tokens I need?
- what are semantic tokens?
- What are component-specific tokens?
- how to create design token documentation?
