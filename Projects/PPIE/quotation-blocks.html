                <p>Too many decisions have historically been made by people in positions of power, and not those who routinely experience the issues themselves. I'm really passionate about ensuring unheard voices are given the space and time to be listened to. Not only does including my voice increase the effectiveness of solutions...but you also open doors to a more fluid and trusting relationship.</p>
