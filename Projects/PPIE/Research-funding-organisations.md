### Grant Application Requirements

**Quote from the NIHR:**

> "The [NIHR is committed](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/shared-commitment-to-public-involvement/30134) to ensuring that meaningful Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) is not an optional extra, but a fundamental element of impactful research. A well-considered and genuinely collaborative plan for [working with people and communities](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/research-funding/application-support/working-with-people-and-communities) significantly strengthens funding applications. We believe people have the right to be involved in all health and social care research, and excellent public involvement is an essential part of this, [having been shown to improve its quality and impact](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/best-practice/public-involvement/impact-public-involvement-ethical-aspects-research/). Indeed, people's personal experiences should be a key driver for health and social care research.
>
> When we talk about public involvement, we mean all the ways in which the research community works together with people and communities, including patients, carers, advocates, service users, and the general public. Excellent public involvement is inclusive, values all contributions, ensures people have a meaningful say in what happens and influences outcomes, as set out in the [UK Standards for Public Involvement](https://sites.google.com/nihr.ac.uk/pi-standards/home).
>
> Part of the decision process for awarding funding at NIHR, involves research applications being reviewed and commented on by committee members with specialist knowledge, experience and expertise in PPIE. They will look for strong evidence of PPIE in the application and allocate a score based on this, this is then collated with peer and scientific reviews to give a final score. The score for PPIE is equally weighted with all other sections of a research application."

### Public Partners on Funding Panels
