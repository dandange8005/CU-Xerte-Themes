            <h4>PPI ACROSS EDUCATION</h4>
            <p>Ways to involve patient &amp; public partners across CBLS education &amp; training</p>
            <h4>CURRICULUM DESIGN &amp; DEVELOPMENT</h4>
            <p>Using lived experiences to help shape what needs to be taught &amp; how.</p>
            <p>Defining learning outcomes that matter to patients.</p>
            <h4>DESIGNING EDUCATION &amp; TEACHING MATERIALS</h4>
            <p>Bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge &amp; what happens in routine practice.</p>
            <p>What is taught is grounded in real-life experiences.</p>
            <h4>DELIVERING TEACHING &amp; TRAINING</h4>
            <p>Patients share their lived experiences in various ways to help illustrate key concepts, and balance the
                clinical and theoretical perspectives.</p>
            <h4>RECRUITMENT &amp; ADMISSIONS</h4>
            <p>Patient and public contributors can play a key role in helping to shape our future health and care
                workforce.</p>
            <p>Assessing key attributes such as empathy, communication &amp; cultural competence.</p>
            <h4>ASSESSMENT &amp; FEEDBACK</h4>
            <p>Adds a valuable non-clinical lens to assessments—balancing technical skills with human interaction and
                compassion.</p>
            <p>Patient insights often lead to more meaningful reflection and growth for students.</p>
            <h4>PROFESSIONAL REVALIDATION</h4>
            <p>Ensures healthcare professionals are assessed not only by peers but also by the people they serve.</p>
            <p>This improves transparency, accountability, and public trust.</p>

            <p>“PPIE helps us break down the often intimidating ‘ivory tower’ imagery that is sometimes associated with
                universities and helps us make a positive impact in the communities in which we work”</p>
            <p>Regulators Requirements</p>
            <p>Professional statutory regulatory bodies (PSRB) increasingly recommend PPIE in curriculum design and
                delivery and validation/revalidation of our education and training.</p>
            <p>Achieving Impact</p>
            <p>Embedding real-world experiences helps translate our findings into policy and practice, which achieves
                impact. It also helps to communicate our work outside the usual environments of academia, business and
                government.</p>
            <p>Funder Requirements</p>
            <p>Funders have prioritised PPIE activity and made it a key criterion for funding success. Writing high
                quality PPIE plans is integral to high quality grant submissions.</p>
            <p>Meets Society&#x27;s Needs</p>
            <p>PPIE plays a vital role in strengthening the relevance and responsiveness of our research, education and
                training - it ensures we address society’s evolving needs and explore things that matter to them.</p>
            <p>Prepared Students</p>
            <p>Provides real experiences and context that complements theoretical and practical knowledge. It helps to
                prepare students for real world settings and introduces them to lived experiences.</p>
            <p>Aligning to Policy</p>
            <p>Legislation and accepted standards promote the value of PPIE e.g. Wellbeing of Future Generations (Wales)
                Act 2015 and the UK Standards for Public Involvement.</p>
            <p>Our Civic Mission</p>
            <p>We have a responsibility to connect and engage with wider society, to support openness and transparency,
                increase accountability and help build public trust in the work that we do.</p>
            <p>Staff Development</p>
            <p>PPIE supports beneficial personal growth and skills development in key areas such as communication
                skills. It can also be fun and rewarding.</p>

            <p>Our four PPIE principles are:</p>
            <p>Meaningful</p>
            <p>Activities should go beyond tokenism. They must be thoughtfully designed to ensure that public and
                patient contributors play a genuine role in shaping research and education.</p>
            <p>Ethical</p>
            <p>Activities must respect the rights, autonomy, and dignity of all participants, ensuring that involvement
                is conducted with transparency, honesty, and fairness.</p>
            <p>Inclusive</p>
            <p>Activities should aim to offer inclusive opportunities that support diverse representation of the voices
                you wish to engage and involve.</p>
            <p>Impactful</p>
            <p>Activities should generate a positive impact and result in tangible benefits for all including

            <p>Real examples taken from across CBLS Learning Case Studies to show PPI impact across the research cycle.
            </p>
            <p>Research prioritisation</p>
            <p>&quot;When working with underserved communities to identify research priorities for the Wales COVID-19
                Evidence Centre, these groups identified priorities that were not identified by the other stakeholders
                (e.g. policy makers, NHS leads). If we had not reached out to these groups, we would have missed key
                topics of our work programme - topics that mattered most to the public in the pandemic recovery&quot;
                from Dr Natalie Joseph-Williams (DPM, MEDIC)</p>
            <p>Planning the research</p>
            <p>&quot;When planning a study with people with learning disabilities, they pointed out that the primary
                outcome used in all trials to date in that area (looking at anger) were staff reported, and no one ever
                counted what they said about what they felt. This resulted in a key change to the trial, changing the
                outcome to self-reported.&quot; from Professor Kerry Hood (CBLS)</p>
            <p>Applying for funding</p>
            <p>&quot;The feedback from the public involvement was acted upon to influence study aims, design, and
                language used in the application to make sure that the project was relevant and needed and had potential
                for societal impact for the underserved population that is the focus of the research.&quot; from Dr Katy
                Hamana (HCARE)</p>
            <p>Conducting research</p>
            <p>&quot;Jan and Sue’s input around the cognitive interviews was particularly crucial. Jan kindly let me do
                a pilot cognitive interview with her, allowing me to better formulate and streamline the prompts and
                questioning. This was very useful for a very inexperienced interviewer like myself, and meant that the
                interviews all generally went smoothly.&quot; from Dr Tim Pickles (Centre for Trials Research)</p>
            <p>Analysis and interpretation</p>
            <p>&quot;Patient &amp; public partners helped challenge assumptions that may have otherwise gone
                unquestioned, such as the idea that digital interventions were universally accessible or that
                ‘participation’ looks the same for everyone. In turn, their contributions aided a more ethical,
                responsive, and grounded project that considered this during analysis.&quot; from Hannah Trotman (HCARE)
            </p>
            <p>Sharing the findings</p>
            <p>&quot;Myself and one of the young committee members were invited to present at the Diabetes UK Annual
                Professional Conference in Glasgow about the committee and what we plan to do, as well as what the
                benefit has been to research. We showcased a video featuring our committee members about why they got
                involved, what they want to achieve from this experience and what advice they would give to
                researchers/clinicians.&quot; from Dr James Pearson (DII, MEDIC)</p>
            <p>Making an impact</p>
            <p>&quot;Through our co-produced work and our lobbying, CACNA1C was added to the NHS PanelApp genomic
                screening, and global genomic testing and healthcare resources were updated for OMIM, Invitae,
                OpenHealth, and Unique.&quot; from Dr Jack Underwood (NMHII, MEDIC)</p>
            <p>Evaluation and reflection</p>
            <p>&quot;We worked with our Public Partnership Group (PPG) at the Health and Care research Wales Evidence
                Centre to reflect on centre processes, including the ways in which we capture PPI impact. The PPG
                identified the challenges of using an existing impact tool in the rapid evidence environment, and helped
                us to adapt the tool so that it was fit for use in these settings.&quot; from Dr Denitza Williams, (DPM,
                MEDIC)</p>

            <p>When planning an engagement activity, it is helpful to respond to the 5Ws.</p>
            <p>Who? Who do you want to engage?</p>
            <p>Think about different demographics; the different hats people wear as well as different attitudes,
                perceptions, interests and experiences people have.</p>
            <p>Why? What do you hope to achieve? (Raise awareness). What is the purpose of your engagement? (Inspire
                others to action).</p>
            <p>When? When will the engagement take place? Think about the accessibility of your activity. What access
                requirements do you need to consider?</p>
            <p>What? What activities will you use? Think about your specific audience’s needs. What ways are the most
                appropriate to provide a positive experience?</p>
            <p>Which? Which methods will you use to evaluate the engagement? How am I going to prove my ‘why?</p>

            <p>Equality Act 2010</p>

            <p>Human Rights Act 1998</p>
            <p>Embeds European Convention on Human Rights into UK law, ensuring rights such as dignity, respect, and

        <summary class="details__summary">View text alternative</summary>
        <div class="details__text">
            <p>Structural and organisational barriers include :</p>
            <p>Lack of diversity in recruitment – involvement opportunities often reach the “usual suspects” rather than
                underrepresented groups.</p>
            <p>Inaccessible processes – systems not designed for people with disabilities, language barriers, or limited
                digital access.</p>
            <p>Insufficient funding for inclusion – lack of budget for interpreters, accessible materials, carer costs,
                computers, or transport support.</p>
            <p>Inflexible institutional policies – rigid times, venues, or formats that don’t accommodate diverse needs.
            </p>
            <p>Limited organisational commitment – EDI is sometimes seen as an “add-on” rather than embedded in research
                culture and leadership priorities.</p>
            <p>Practical and accessibility barriers include:</p>
            <p>Timing and location – activities scheduled during working hours or in inaccessible places.</p>
            <p>Digital exclusion – reliance on online engagement tools that not everyone can access or navigate.</p>
            <p>Complex information – use of technical, academic, or medical language that excludes non-specialists.</p>
            <p>Unclear roles or expectations – contributors may not understand their purpose or influence, leading to
                disengagement.</p>
            <p>Insufficient feedback – contributors not told how their input has shaped outcomes, causing feelings of
                tokenism.</p>
            <p>Cultural and social barriers include:</p>
            <p>Lack of trust – historical or cultural mistrust of research institutions, particularly among marginalised
                communities.</p>
            <p>Perceived power imbalances – contributors may feel their voices are undervalued compared to
                professionals.</p>
            <p>Underrepresentation of lived experience – dominance of certain voices can unintentionally exclude others
                (e.g. by ethnicity, age, socioeconomic background, disability, gender identity).</p>
            <p>Cultural insensitivity – poor awareness of cultural norms, communication preferences, or religious
                considerations.</p>
            <p>Individual and psychological barriers</p>
            <p>Low confidence or perceived lack of expertise – individuals may feel “not qualified” to contribute to
                research discussions.</p>
            <p>Fear of stigma or judgement – especially for people with certain health conditions or personal
                experiences.</p>
            <p>Language barriers – lack of translated materials or interpretation support.</p>
            <p>Lower levels of literacy - lacking confidence to engage with materials</p>
            <p>Previous negative experiences – poor treatment in earlier involvement projects discourages future
                participation.</p>

            <strong>Key steps that can help you to identify which groups are missing</strong>
            - <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAG1xjIZMNk/FdIuYTVaQOVak8SV-_20uA/view?utm_content=DAG1xjIZMNk&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link2&amp;utm_source=uniquelinks&amp;utlId=hf0e5e231e5"

        <summary class="details__summary">View text alternative</summary>
        <div class="details__text">
            <p><strong>Step 1 - Map the current participant landscape</strong></p>
            <p>Review your data: Look at who has been involved in your PPIE activities so far. Note demographics such as
                age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, geographic location, disability, health condition, and
                language spoken.</p>
            <p>Identify patterns: Are certain groups consistently absent or underrepresented?</p>
            <p><strong>Step 2 - Compare with the target population</strong></p>
            <p>Understand the population affected: Who is the research intended to benefit? Who’s voices do you need to
                hear from?</p>
            <p>Compare representation: Identify gaps by comparing your PPIE participants with the actual diversity of
                the population. For example, are older adults represented if the research concerns age-related
                conditions? Or are minority ethnic groups included if they are disproportionately affected by the health
                condition that your engagement event is about?</p>
            <p><strong>Step 3 - Use data and evidence</strong></p>
            <p>Demographic and epidemiological data: National or regional statistics can help highlight groups at risk
                or historically underserved.</p>
            <p>Health inequalities reports: Many public health agencies publish insights on groups who face barriers in
                accessing care or participating in research.</p>
            <p><strong>Step 4 - Engage key stakeholders</strong></p>
            <p>Community organisations: Local charities, advocacy groups, and social services often know which groups
                are underserved e.g. The Gateway Pavilion in Cardiff.</p>
            <p>Existing patient advisory boards: They can provide insight into who is missing and why.</p>
            <p>Community gatekeepers and leaders: are key to facilitating access and designing appropriate PPIE
                activities</p>
            <p><strong>Step 5 - Explore barriers and facilitators to involvement</strong></p>
            <p>Accessibility issues: Timing, location, transport, digital exclusion, or disability accommodations.</p>
            <p>Cultural or linguistic barriers: Are materials available in different languages or culturally sensitive
                formats?</p>
            <p>Trust and engagement issues: Historical marginalisation or negative experiences with healthcare/research
                may make some groups reluctant to participate.</p>

            <p>1. Community outreach and education</p>
            <p>Collaborating with local organisations to raise awareness about PPIE and its importance can help inform
                underrepresented communities</p>
            <p>2. Building trust through relationships</p>
            <p>Partnering with community leaders and organisation can help foster trust and facilitates more meaingful
                engagement</p>
            <p>3. Inclusive recruitment processes</p>
            <p>Using multiple channels, including community events and social media, tailored to each group&#x27;s
                needs, ensures broad reach</p>
            <p>4. Flexible involvement options</p>
            <p>Offering various ways to engage, such as virtual meetings or small group discussions, can accomodate
                different schedules and preferences, while incentives can address finanical barriers</p>
            <p>5. Feedback and adaptation</p>
            <p>Gathering feedback from participants and adjusting approaches demonstrates a commitment to inclusivity.
            </p>
            <p>By engaging individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds, research becomes more reflective of
                real-world concerns, ensuring relevant outcomes and improving the impact of cancer research. These
                efforts can foster a research environment where inclusive, meaningful PPIE thrives.</p>
