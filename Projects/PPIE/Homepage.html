                        development group.
                    </p>
                    <p>We pilot tested the training programme with XX staff and XX postgraduate research students in
                        September 2025 and used the feedback to refine the resource.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Each module was co-led by an academic lead(s) and at least one public

                        and communications.
